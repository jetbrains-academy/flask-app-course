### What this course is about

This course will guide you step by step through the process of building a backend application consisting of multiple microservices with Flask.
Our application will consist of two backend components: a simple API that performs basic CRUD operations on a database and an API gateway backend that routs client requests. 
You will also learn to deploy your application on Docker and test it with Postman.

### Target Audience
