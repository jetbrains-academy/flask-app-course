### What this course is about

What we intend to make is a backend application consisting of multiple micro-services.
We'll be building a simple API that performs some basic CRUD operations on a database of smart home devices. For simplicity, we are going 
to be using a Python `shelf` object instead of a real database solution.
The additional step will be an API gateway backend which is a sort of router and authoriser of the client requests. 
This means our application will consist of two backend components, one being the inventory manager, and one being the api gateway. 
The application will expose a RESTful interface.
