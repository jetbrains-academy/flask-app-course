### What this course is about

This course is going to guide you step-by-step through the process of building a backend application consisting of multiple micro-services with Flask.
Our application will consist of two backend components: a simple API that performs basic CRUD operations on a database and an API gateway backend - a router of the client requests. 
You will also learn to deploy your application on Docker and target it with Postman.
