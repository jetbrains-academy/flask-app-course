This is a course for beginners who want to learn how to build a backend application consisting of multiple microservices with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/). In this course, you will create an application consisting of two backend components: 
1. A simple API that performs basic CRUD (Create, Read/Retrieve, Update, and Delete) operations on a database.
2. An API gateway backend that routes client requests.
   
You will also learn how to deploy your application on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) using the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) tool and test it with [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/).
